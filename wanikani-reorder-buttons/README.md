# WaniKani Reorder Buttons

This script will add two buttons to the bottom of the WaniKani review page that
will reorder your remaining reviews by their SRS order.

The ordering can be either ascending or descending, though on start-up, items
will be reordered in ascending order. Review items will also have their meaning
and readings be asked in immediate succession.

This script started as a modified copy of Towe's
[WaniKani SRS Reorder Button](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/29673-wanikani-srs-reorder-button).
Their original WaniKani community post can be found
[here](https://community.wanikani.com/t/wanikani-srs-reorder-button/17880).

## HotKeys

There are two hotkeys registered for this script:

- `Alt` + `Shift` + `-`: reorder review items by SRS level in descending order
- `Alt` + `Shift` + `=`: reorder review items by SRS level in ascending order
